# steps to getthis working

- add google-service.json
- add signing debug keystore hash to firebase project

# reproduce the issue
- start app on android device
- click on button
-> even though no error happens the idToken is null

- uncomment the client ID to set the client ID via the intializaiton of the GoogleSignIn creates a error 10 (so at least some feedback) never the less no way to fix that one.


merry Xmas & happy new year
